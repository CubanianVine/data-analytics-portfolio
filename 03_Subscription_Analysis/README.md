# Subscription Business Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the key financial and user behavior metrics of a subscription-based business model. The analysis focuses on customer retention, churn, revenue per user, and the overall financial health of the service.
It combines metric calculations, visual exploration, and business interpretation — with an emphasis on actionable insights for subscription-based products.
